# Yoda Speak translator App

    This app converts from English to Yoda speak made with fun translations API. Yoda often orders sentences as Object-Subject-Verb, split verbs, switches entire phrases and sometimes uses sentences that are different from his normal syntax! Because of this it is difficult to accurately represent his sentence structure.
    Have fun and may the force be with you!
